Welcome to the Word Guessing Game! A simple yet entertaining game showcasing the use of Python basics, including input handling, loops, functions and randomization

### Introduction
This game prompts the player to guess a ramdomly chosen word from a predefined list. What makes it unique? W've added a peroonalized touch👇 

> Players name -

This was added to act as a form of knowing who the player is. You are being propmted to input your name

This was added to verify the perso age. I limited the age section from 5 to 20 years old. Within this age youu can play the game or u are exited if above the age limit 

## Basics Used

- **Input Handling:** Collecting player's name, age, and letter guesses.
- **Loops:** Creating iterative game flow until the word is guessed or attempts run out.
- **Functions:** Modularizing code for readability and reusability.
- **Randomization:** Choosing a random word from a predefined list.


## How to Play

- **Initialization:** Upon running the game, you'll be greeted and asked to input your name and age. This personal touch adds a fun element to the game.

- **Guessing the Word:** You'll then enter the main game loop, where you guess letters to uncover the hidden word. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.

- **Game Outcome:** The game concludes when you either successfully guess the word or run out of attempts. The outcome is displayed along with a congratulatory or encouraging message.
